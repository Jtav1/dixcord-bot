 Discord Bot for Justin's Discord
 
 Extremely rudimentary, proof of concept for a working discord bot. Will need significant upgrades before we can switch off Slack and rely on this bot. 
 
 Also consider hosting. Lambdas? Heroku server? Something that won't go offline when Justin's power goes out.
